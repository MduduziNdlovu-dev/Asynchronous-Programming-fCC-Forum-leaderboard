![alt text](image.png)

Welcome to the **fCC Forum Leaderboard**! This project fetches and displays the latest discussions from the freeCodeCamp forum in a clean, responsive, and dynamic table format. It's a showcase of my front-end development skills, using modern JavaScript, API handling, and responsive design.

## 📌 Features

- **Dynamic UI Updates:** Renders posts, avatars, categories, views, replies, and activity timestamps in real time.
- **Category Highlighting:** Posts are color-coded based on their category.
- **Responsive Design:** Looks great on all screen sizes with smooth scrolling.
- **Clean & Modern UI:** Styled with CSS and structured for readability and maintainability.
